## Introduction
Personalized Discord bot, made in Python, will have different versions in the future.

It understands each user it is interacting with and gives them responses that are based on their preferences to be of better service.

## Sourcing
I would like to have open source version to increase development time, however it may focus on also having a closed version sometime in the future.

## Features
- Full data customization per user, server, group.
- Many features with ability to customize internal commands and functionality with sharable and scalable presets.
- Intertwine features to allow syncable data reads from other bots.
- Viewable and sortable analytics, ability to give out an output.
- AI tools and functionality to allow bot change its own functional code on demand.
- General built in modular features such as starboards, marketplace features, moderation, feeds, automation, utilities, AI, creative, gamedev related, as well as economy and entertainment related features.
- And much more.

## Notes
Mostly use Visual Studio Code for the making of this bot, and it is deployed using Railway.
Programmed on Python for flexibility, uses PostgresDB for database handling.
